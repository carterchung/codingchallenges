Factorial
============
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number

Background
---------------------
A factorial is written as:
```
x!
```
This evaluates to:
```
x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) * ... (x - (x - 1))
```
Example
---------------------
```
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
factorial(5) = 120
```
